GoogleApiPython3x
=================

This is an unofficial port to Python 3.x of the python client library for Google's discovery based APIs.
It is a work-in-progress, feel free to contribute.


Version 3.0: Initial translation of 2.7 code to 3.x grammar using the 2to3 tool and some
  minor postmodifications. Google API now works for basic functionality. OAuth has not,
  however, been tested yet. Still pending: validating the complete test suite from the
  official Google 2.7 codebase


Installation
